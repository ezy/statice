### Weekly repayments calculator (interest only)

Assuming a deposit of 20% and an average Auckland price of around the $750K mark if the rates go up, expect to pay the interest plus capital on whatever your loan amount is. And it's not a matter of if with this one, but rather when (but let's not hope it's anytime soon). ![Fig3_large](/images/posts/Fig3_large.jpg)

### Income fluctuation

A lot of families are DIKS - that is Double Income (with) Kids. So what happens if they have the aforementioned debt levels and become SIKS (Single Income (with) Kids)? If we simplify things by creating a blanket tax rate of 30% to account for GST, rates and the like to make calculations easier, the rough figures are as follows:

#### 500k loan at 5% ($480.77 int/wk)



**Yearly income**

50,000

75,000

100,000

125,000

150,000

**Income / wk (gross)**

480.77

961.54

1,442.31

1,923.08

2,403.85

**Income / wk (net)**

336.54

673.08

1,009.61

1,346.15

1,682.69

#### 700k loan at 5% ($673.08 int/wk)



Yearly income

50,000

75,000

100,000

125,000

150,000

Income / wk (gross)

288.46

769.23

1,250.00

1,730.77

2,211.54

Income / wk (net)

201.92

538.46

875.00

1,211.54

1,548.07

Now if you factor the double whammy of one partner out of work along with a small interest rate rise.

#### 700k loan at 6% ($807.69 int/wk)



Yearly income

50,000

75,000

100,000

125,000

150,000

Income / wk (gross)

153.85

634.62

1,115.39

1,596.16

2,076.93

Income / wk (net)

107.69

444.23

780.77

1,117.31

1,453.85

And when we get back to an historically normal average of around 7.6% the figures start getting pretty uncomfortable - remember this is interest only without any capital repayments.

#### 700k loan at 7.6% ($807.69 int/wk)



Yearly income

50,000

75,000

100,000

125,000

150,000

Income / wk (gross)

-61.54

419.23

900.00

1,380.77

1,861.54

Income / wk (net)

-43.08

293.46

630.00

966.54

1,303.07

Once again, none of this matters of course, as long as there's a healthy amount of financial liquidity.
