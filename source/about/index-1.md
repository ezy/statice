"Getting information off the Internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant."  ~[Mitch Kapor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor) In the present day, understanding and leveraging the power of the internet to promote, inform, research, thin-slice, [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok),  live, breath, and work is becoming more of a necessity than ever before. Thanks to Google, everyone has a brand on the internet whether they realise it or not. How many results does your name produce when searched and what is the nature of those results?  As designers how do we control our personal and professional brand? How do we differentiate and veto the ever-thinner line between an intended public and private domain when information is non-degradable? This course will initiate a toolkit for the designer/developer that they can use and build on. A standards based structural approach to the application of these tools will be implemented from the personal to professional domain, while encouraging a considered philosophical approach to discover and promote one's own personal point of view. Fabrication will be methodical - identity will be built up in a modular way over the course of the paper with a striated final result that leaves the students with a foundational base to build their ongoing professional identity on. This paper is part marketing, part technical, part artistic, full design - demonstrating the multi-faceted nature of the emergent market place of the global economy. The term interweb has been used in place of internet, to highlight collected mind-power and the corporate nature of central processing power attributed to the collective. **COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES**
