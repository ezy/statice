Howdy folks

![ie](https://i1.createsend1.com/ei/r/57/D0E/417/csimport/GWtiJFA.105445.jpg)

Here's a bit of a round up of what's been going on with Ezra and Wellington Web for June. I'll try and keep it short, fresh and interesting. It's been a stellar month on many fronts, and there's a good deal of work life balance happening. Work has been steady and there's plenty on the books for the next few months.

So enjoy the read, and feel free to share via Facebook and Twitter if there's anything you deem worthy.

Cheers
Ezra

Here's the latest site roll out for autom8, a software testing company that has an amazing product that automates tests in word and excel. Possibly the toughest build we've ever done (being that for software testers) as everything was put through their exacting standards. But at the end of the day, the client was extremely pleased with the outcome and we delivered.

The Wellington Web site has been redesigned once more. And once more it's responsive for mobile. This time round we've gone for some parallax effects which are particularly hawt right now.

Consistently Smashing SEO

Congrats to our clients who are consistantly getting into the top 10 of Google's search results for some of the most competitive keywords on the internet. It's common place for them to end up in the top 5 of organic search results for some of the most hotly contested keywords around. We're beating out some of the biggest names in the business, and we're not even officially an SEO company!

[Best of Youtube](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-bllktdt-l-jj/)

And last but not least, the best thing we've seen on Youtube this past week has got to be Russel brand showing up the rather dopey presenters on American Channel MSNBC's Morning Joe, which I suppose is the equivalent of breakfast tv here in NZ. As you can see from the image, Russel's pretty unhappy from the start.
