It feels like there’s a lot going down at the moment. Although perhaps ironically, we’re actually living in a time, that according to a study by Florida University is the most [peaceful in all of history](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-y/). But if you asked any passer by on the street whether this was the case, I doubt they’d say the same. So why this feeling, contrary to the evidence? Read on for more discourse.

## What you can expect in this issue:

*   Some thoughts about Tribal Media
*   A debate between three enemies who are the same person
*   NZ Tech Radar
*   A non-profit start up

# Social Media is actually tribal media

Often twitter is called an “echo chamber” where opinions get tweeted and retweeted through different networks. This causes certain news **to be amplified**. Armchair activists pile on an issue for a short time, giving it huge exposure, especially if “[an influencer](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-i/)” is involved. But often, ironically the targets of the conversation are benefitting from the exposure.

This in turn lays the foundations for the modern condition, where _it doesn’t matter what people are saying about you, but only that you’re being talked about_ or:

> _“any publicity is good publicity”_

If a social media platform where most people have less followers, than people they’re following tells us anything, it’s that [people are desperate for relevance](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-d/). They’re happy to mostly shout into the void until an issue comes along that they “feel strongly about”, and then they certainly won’t let constructive dialogue get in the way of their clicktivism. They typically align themselves with a tribe and then pile on with the likes, upvotes and/or retweets.

## I know you are, you said you are

We saw an example of this **locally** over the last few weeks, when Auckland City Council banned Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern from using the council's publicly funded venues. Twitter exploded with opinions (proportioned to Twitter’s follower demographics) and there was ne’er a balanced objective discussion in sight. The Spinoff seemed to be one of the only news publications in New Zealand [reporting from both sides](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-k/), trying to look at the issue from different angles.

But the biggest outcome by far from all of this, was an enormous amount of exposure for Molyneux and Southern. And unfortunately, this is how the narrative often plays out. The most negative, sensational views get picked up by a fairly lazy media, using social networks like a school kid using Wikipedia as their only source for a school project, at the expense of objective investigative reporting.

A wise scholar once said:

> _“I’d say you’ll do best by filling your minds and meditating on things true, noble, reputable, authentic, compelling, gracious—the best, not the worst; the beautiful, not the ugly; things to praise, not things to curse.”_

Whilst we’re still living in the most [peaceful time this planet has ever seen](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-u/), we should take that advice on board and engage in both local and international issues with objectivity and an open mind, founded on as many authenticated sources we can gather.

I’d urge you to read as widely as you can, and find diverse sources of content. We have far more in common than not, and as per Abraham Lincoln’s [House Divided Speech](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-o/) on the subject of slavery:

> _“If we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could then better judge what to do, and how to do it.” _

# NZ tech radar

For the longest time I’ve been a big admirer of [Enspiral](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-b/), and the work they’ve done. I’ve lived in Wellington for over 20 years, but have also spent several years working in the Auckland tech scene getting a feel for the culture up there. I believe Enspiral is a great reflection of what makes the Wellington tech culture so great (and very different from Auckland) - open source, collaborative, future focused, people centric, and closely proximate..

So it makes perfect sense that a product like Scuttlebutt, a social network designed around how humans communicate was [born out of their office](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-n/). Scuttlebutt is a decentralised network for sharing information, where the user is in control of the connection. The tech itself is still reasonably high level, requiring a familiarity with the command line to access and install, but the idea itself is fascinating. Take a look at the intro video:

And if you’re up for trying it out all the info to install it is hosted on github on the [Patchwork client](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-x/) repo.

# Why I chose to pour hundreds of after-work hours into the most done to death idea on the internet

For the last few months I’ve been head down after hours, working on a non-profit project I’ve dubbed [Newseed](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-m/).

If you read my article about [the year and a bit I spent building a start-up, and the lessons I learnt](https://medium.com/@ezy_/the-entrepreneur-the-idealist-and-the-money-grubber-ad8af80ca206) you’ll know it was an intense experience. One of the biggest take-outs from that year for me which has been firmly reinforced since:

## The internet has become a greedy place

We’ve got companies being bought and sold for literally billions of dollars, whilst families who own just a few meagre possessions and a smart-phone search for asylum. “Founders” are all about “the hustle”, and pursue start-up gains at any cost. Uber sized companies with uber budgets and shareholders, aggressively defend their market-share [forcing small players to assimilate or die](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-c/).

When I finally felt like I’d detoxed from my own start-up, I started thinking about building something again. I’ve got a [Keep](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-q/) list with over a hundred ideas for a new internet business, so what should it be?

*   A meetup app that connects people to events based on their interests rather than event content?
*   An art experiment that allows people to swarm in locations creating map based content hotspots?
*   A space invaders game where the enemy is content and kids learn about subject matter by shooting the be-jesus out of it?

## Or maybe a CMS (content management system), one of the most overdone ideas in the history of the web?

It's not sexy like VR or ground-breaking like AI, but the stars aligned when the small church I go to, needed to refresh their website. But rather than doing what I should have and spending a week knocking together a Wordpress site, I’m building a completely bespoke web app to deliver audience specific content.

## Why?

Because the internet is primarily a place for content, and I have access to [some great](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-a/) content that fits the “true, noble, reputable, authentic, compelling, and gracious” moniker. And we need more of that online as previously discussed.

I’m still finalising how the non-profit will operate, and it will be a learning curve, but the basic premise is no shareholders, and all of the profits go back into growing the application.

Most of the code will be open sourced - the first big chunk was put online yesterday - a [headless CMS built in Javascript](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-f/) that follows the conventions of the Wordpress schema. It’s [currently in beta](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-z/) (launched last week), and if you’re receiving this email, I’ll be making sporadic updates as per usual over the next few months.

# Finally, I’ve got a favour to ask

I’m crap at marketing - always have been. If you've made it this far through, you’re enjoying this email, and can think of someone who might also enjoy it, can you share the sign-up link to the newsletter signup page on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn?

[http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/h/r/0F2A3743C5AF7F28](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jjaiydt-l-v/)

That’d be awesome.
