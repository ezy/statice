So I was trying to install a gpg key on my Ubuntu Trusty server but kept getting the following error:

```
Executing: gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --homedir
/tmp/tmp.U83lQ36Gpz --no-auto-check-trustdb --trust-model always --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
--primary-keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv EA312927
gpg: requesting key EA312927 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com ?: keyserver.ubuntu.com:
Host not found gpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 7: couldn't connect: Connection refused gpg:
no valid OpenPGP data found. gpg: Total number processed: 0
```

A tonne of posts were talking about proxy settings and other issues. But the easiest fix in the end was to manually add the key. All I did was to search for the key on MIT's pgp search engine - <https://pgp.mit.edu/> (click on the key to see the key data) And then run the following commands to manually add the key: `sudo apt-key add -` Paste the text (middle-click or use copy/paste) Press ctrl + D In my case the pasted text was for Mongodb:
