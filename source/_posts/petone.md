There is love in this place It is woven into the fabric of the air, by a young couple There is love in this place It tears the quiet of the room, with this new babies cry There is love in this place It looks up with a child's eyes, to see it's mother There is love in this place It's a refuge from a busy world There is love in this place It is shaped by the memories that have gone before May there be many more _\- leaving our small Petone home of eight years (Oct 2013)_
