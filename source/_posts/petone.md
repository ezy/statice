There is love in this place
It is woven into the fabric of the air, by a young couple
There is love in this place
It tears the quiet of the room, with this new babies cry
There is love in this place
It looks up with a child's eyes, to see it's mother
There is love in this place
It's a refuge from a busy world
There is love in this place
It is shaped by the memories that have gone before
May there be many more
