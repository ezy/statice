It's been a long time since I sent out an email - there's some extremely exciting reasons why that's the case, on which I'd like to fill you in...

## After 6 years, Wellington Web is winding up

I started Wellington Web after coming back from paternity leave to my UX Design job at a Wellington media agency, where I was immediately made redundant. It was a formative and character building time. We'd just had our second child who was only a few weeks old; but I'd been thinking about going out on my own for a while, and believed that there was a huge amount of opportunity to develop quality marketing websites for SMEs using Open Source technology without a price tag in the tens of thousands. So, I incorporated [Passionfruit Online Media Ltd](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-qujgky-l-j/)., joined BNI and setup a marketing website at [wellingtonweb.co.nz](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-qujgky-l-t/). That was 6 years ago and along the way I've met some great people, and am happy to have produced some great results for over 100 different clients. My estimate from analytics is, that over 80% of clients received a 100% return on their initial spend within 6 - 12 months of launching their marketing site. In many client cases, only a few extra leads were required in the first 3 months to recoup the relatively small amount spent. I still believe that having a simple and effective website that acts as an online brochure or lead generation form, and has a specific call to action asking customers to buy is a key ingredient for any small business. The landscape is ever changing, but it's a still good idea to include a strategy that incorporates Google SEO, as well as an increasing number of niche channels where potential local customers exist in their hundreds of thousands.

## Where to from here with Wellington Web?

It's with a mix of emotions that I've made the decision not to take on any new business under the Wellington Web moniker. For my existing clients who have websites and hosting with me still - I'm committed to maintaining what you currently have in place indefinitely. However, It would be in your interests to review your web presence soon, as some of you need a refreshed template that's mobile device ready. For new work, I can recommend three Wellington based businesses who specialise in Wordpress for you to follow up -

*   Zing - [zingdesign.com](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-qujgky-l-i/) (best all round)
*   Grafik - [grafik.co.nz](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-qujgky-l-d/) (best for Wordpress design)
*   Prefer - [prefer.co.nz](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-qujgky-l-h/) (best for corporates)

But otherwise I'd like to thank you all sincerely for your business over the years, and I wish you all the best for the future. If we aren't already connected on Linked In, please add me to your network [nz.linkedin.com/in/ezrakeddell](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-qujgky-l-k/).

## 2014-15 Summary

Many of you will know that our family made the transition to Auckland from Wellington in Feb '14 to be closer to family. It was a big move after being in our beloved Welly for over 15 years. We're now starting to feel like we've settled a bit more, we're seeing more of our family than ever, and although we miss our Wellington friends, we're loving Auckland and all it has to offer. It's also meant a number of changes for us on the business front. For the better part of the last 3 years I've balanced Wellington Web and also contract work as a specialist UX/UI Designer and Front End Developer for the likes of Xero, Yellow Group, Vodafone and various Government agencies and other businesses. 2015 marks another step forward, with our family deciding to forgo getting into the madness that is the Auckland property market, and use some of our capital to focus on delivering a range of web apps that will appeal to an international market. Enter Wiry.

## The future

From passionfruit.co.nz

> We have a unique opportunity in this small piece of Godzone down at the bottom of the planet. What if there was a product that cost nothing to produce except time? And that same product could then be scaled almost infinitely, and delivered instantaneously to the customers that are wanting it. If the customers like the product, they could then effortlessly tell their friends about it with a single click of a mouse. And those customers make up the largest market place in the world where a niche can be upwards of 3 million people. Hell, you'd probably say it's the perfect opportunity for a country like ours down at the bottom of the world. And you'd be right, it bloody well is. And right now the opportunity, enjoyment and potential financial reward in this industry is pretty astronomical, and it's a privilege to be part of it.

Since February of this year, I've been working full time building no less than 4 different web apps. I've partnered with a great developer, and we're due to start rolling them out over the next few months under the parent company brand 'Wiry'. We're mostly still in the 'cave of development' at the moment, but if you'd like to keep up with what we're doing, stay on this mailing list, as I'll be making periodic updates as we launch each web app.

Which brings me to the first web app we've launched - getsafely.com.
