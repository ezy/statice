I've been running a lightly modified version of [Higherground](http://www.seobilgi.com/wordpress-higherground-theme.html) which has suited my purposes thus far. At some stage in the near future I'll hopefully get enough time to sort out a fully customised theme. But until then, I've created a [downloads](http://www.infofoundry.net/downloads) page and periodically I plan to host anything that seems it might be useful for the future. Below is the process I went through to set it up:

1.  I searched for the type of plugin I would need and trialled a couple including [drain hole](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/drain-hole-1/#post-2333).
2.  I decided on [Download Monitor](http://blue-anvil.com/archives/wordpress-download-monitor-plugin) because it suited my purposes and was extremely user friendly.
3.  I [downloaded](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/download-monitor/#post-4822) and installed it via Fire FTP, and uploaded the InfoFoundry Higherground theme available for all.

Drain hole would be handy if you were using SVN, but as far as a simple app to manage downloading through the Wordpress admin panel - my pick would have to be Download Monitor.
