Once again we'll be splitting presentations up into groups of 6 for Friday. This time round will be a little different as the crits will be run in a more traditional format, but with a group of 6. So bring your best opinions, and be prepared to give some constructive feedback. For anyone who hasn't signed up yet, email me - there are 3 spaces left in the second group at 4.55pm.
