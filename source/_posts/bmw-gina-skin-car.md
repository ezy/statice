BMW show that they are thinking outside the square with this beautiful concept on skinning cars. It is great to see leading designers and manufacturers continuing on a path of innovation and pushing the boundaries of the everyday. After all, it’s very easy to get caught up in conventions that are outdated because of familiarity. This is something that I need to build into my everyday thinking as an IA. It is extremely important as an IA to know the conventions of the web and design sites around usability. But the real exciting part of the job is finding the opportunities to break conventions in an innovative way. This is what BMW are doing with this design concept. They are shocking people in a really attractive way to think outside the square. This is design on the edge (to use a cliché) where creativity redefines convention. Bravo BMW, bravo.
