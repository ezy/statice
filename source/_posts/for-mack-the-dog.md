Bury me deep my friend Down where the core of the earth can warm my bones To forget that the twilight years made me cold Where the strength of the elements will shore me up As I sail beyond to that ever golden plain And my heart will beat for ever more In the place where our friendship dawned And I left my heart in yours _– on the death of the family dog (Dec 2015)_
