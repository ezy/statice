Bury me deep my friend
Down where the core of the earth can warm my bones
To forget that the twilight years made me cold
Where the strength of the elements will shore me up
As I sail beyond to that ever golden plain
And my heart will beat for ever more
In the place where our friendship dawned
And I left my heart in yours
