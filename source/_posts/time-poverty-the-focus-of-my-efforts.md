I have once again (sadly) become a time poor person as I finish a paper at [Victoria University](http://www.vuw.ac.nz/design/index.php). I have had a heap of ideas, and developments on the IA front, but haven’t had the capacity to muse about them, which makes for a much less creative me. The stack of snippets and segments I want to write about is slowly amassing in my briefcase folder, and who knows if they will still be as relevant in the seven or so weeks it will take for me to finish… But the good news is that the energy that otherwise would have been expended from musing, is currently being directed to this [4four12 project](http://infofoundry.net/4four12/ "4four12 paper"). And it’s coming along swimmingly.
