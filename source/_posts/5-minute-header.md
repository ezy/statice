Here's a sketch that I put together when I needed a bit of creative out time with no consequences. It is 1000 x 150 which means that it shouldn't take up too much room and should work well on a 1024 x 768 format screen (which is currently the majority of the world apparently). It's nice and generic and comes in four different colours for your header viewing pleasure. The style is a little bit grunge mixed with the slightest amount of web2.0. If you want to download the zip file with all four different colours it is in the downloads section.
