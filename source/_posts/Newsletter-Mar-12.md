Wordpress (an open source web content management system) is the weapon of choice for 95% of the projects we do for people. You might have heard some stuff about "Open Source" and "Content Management Systems" and wondered what on earth those things are.

Testimonial: More Client Lovin'

**A testimonial from another satisfied client:**

_Ezra Keddell designed an awesome website for Love Hairdressing. He was easy to understand, he took his time explaining things, which is important considering our very basic computer knowledge. We now have a site which we feel is very modern and interesting that we are very proud of. Ezra is also a fabulous photographer, who was able to capture us with a very relaxed casual appearance.Weâ€™re very happy here at love hairdressing._
