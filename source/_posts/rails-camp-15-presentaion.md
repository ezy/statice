I gave a presentation at NZ Rails Camp '15 about a Twitter Bootstrap vs. Zurb Foundation vs. BourbonÂ CSS frameworks and a high level overview of what they contained. It was well received so I thought I'd pop it up for posterity. \[slideshare id=47884063&doc=ruby-camp-pres-2015-ek-150507204033-lva1-app6892\]
