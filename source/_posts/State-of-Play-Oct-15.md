### A long overdue update from Ezra about what he's up to:

For the last 6 months Ezra and the Wiry team (Justin) have been working our rings off to ship our most ambitious project to date - [kandid.nz](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-ztuykg-l-y/). We're bloody excited about this software as a service with a couple of thousand hours having been lovingly poured into developing another NZ Saas product that can get some export dollars flowing and make NZ awesomer.

## What is kandid?

[Kandid.nz](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-ztuykg-l-t/) is a new way for IT folks to get paid what they think they're worth. Anyone with skills in the IT sector can register on the site, and load their skills and experience - setting a $ rate that they want to be paid. They'll end up with an online profile where folks can search for specific skills, and have concrete expectations about how much they'll be paying the geeks they hire.

## Who's it for?

Developers, Designers, Business Analysts, Technical people, Project managers, in fact anyone who is involved in the production of the IT industry. Especially if you're in a role at the moment and thinking about dipping your toe in the job market with minimal hassle.

## Ask for top $$$

Have a crack and put your top rate up, an amount that you'd feel a bit embarrassed asking for. One hundred percent of the advertised $$$ go to you, so because there's no agency taking a cut, you can add 10%-30% on top of what you'd normally get. You might be surprised. Good quality IT people are in massive demand right now and the ball is squarely in our court. In fact it's been exceptionally hard developing kandid for this very reason - I've been turning down on average, a couple of job offers a week as a Designer and Front-end developer with AngularJS skills! (did I mention kandid is built using Angular)

## How does it work?

When someone is looking for a geek with your skills they search for any those skills in the search box. The results of all the people in the system with the corresponding skill sets display in a list as per the picture below. If the searcher wants to see the contact details of the geek in the list, then they add them to their shortlist. An email gets pinged out to the geek, with details about the organisation and person who's searching them. Simple as that.

## What are those crazy numbers on the tiles?

I'm quietly pretty chuffed with the design work that's gone in to represent the skills search. The basic unit of information is what's called the skill tile - a rectangle design element that contains all the information about a persons given skill within their skill-set. It has all the information needed to know about someone's experience, projects and qualifications in that given skill:

We won an award for [Dotty](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-ztuykg-l-k/)! Back in July we pitched at the Idealog Pitch Circus evening. The audience loved our chores manager for kids, and voted for us with a 92% approval rating. It was a bunch of fun! Check out me pitching in my swanky velvet jacket below:
