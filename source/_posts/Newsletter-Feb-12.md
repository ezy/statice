Glowing review

Last of all, we recently had a glowing report from the guys over at [GMR Metal Recylers in Lower Hutt](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r/l/dlitxk/l/ji/):

_In building our new web site we were faced with a big challenge.  A ground up total rebuild.
Ezraâ€™s straight forward approach  from the start put our minds at rest.  He listened and delivered us what we believe is the best web site in our industry in New Zealand.
We are totally delighted in the way he has helped us present a professional image to our customers with the ability to deliver solid communication and it is such a powerful and easy tool to use in our business.
He is always available and no matter what the question he approaches with the manner of being of total service.
The feedback from the site has been incredible.  Our business is recycling which is a future bound business.  Ezra and his company  Passionfruit have help us take a leap into that future._

Thanks a bunch guys and we're stoked you're so happy with the new site.
