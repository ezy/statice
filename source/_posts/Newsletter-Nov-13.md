Kia ora koutou,

There's been a fair bit on recently but I thought it was high time I sent out an email with some of the best internet things I've found, what's what with business on the web, general chit chat and a recent project.

## Google Glass

This month I managed to get hold of a pair of [Google Glass](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-ndjddud-l-s/) Glasses. As far as functionality goes, out of the box they're pretty limited currently - but there's no doubt that they're going to be a big part of the future of the internet. The stand out thing was by far the quality of the voice recognition - even my kiwi accent was understood.

There's a whole bunch of new innovations coming to the market including the likes of [Leap Motion](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-ndjddud-l-g/), which have already touched down and are available to consumers already. All that's left to see is how far the designers can push the packet for these new platforms.

Our latest website build was for local furniture designer Craig Lambie. We used a clean look and feel for the design that was in keeping with the sort of brand Craig was looking to present. A big part of the site was showing off Craig's excellent craftsmanship, so there was big emphasis placed on the portfolio and high definition imagery.

[What makes Greatness in Leadership?](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-ndjddud-l-yk/)

One of the best things I've seen recently on Youtube is this annotated talk of what makes a great leader by an ex Submarine Captain.

It's pretty common sense stuff when you think about, but seems to be somehow sadly lacking in many areas of business today.

Need mobile?

![Mobile stats graph](https://i4.createsend1.com/ei/r/FA/8D7/69F/csimport/jun-2013-mobile-operating-systems.154723.png)

TradeMe released their [June stats](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-ndjddud-l-jr/) and they show that a whopping 16% of all site visits were made on a mobile device. This is an increasing trend and the reality for businesses of all sizes is, that if their website isn't catering for mobile using a mobile specific site (or better yet responsive design) they're potentially missing out on 16% of new business through their site. **Did you know that all the sites we build now have a responsive design built specifically for all browsers including mobile?**

[If you'd like to know more about responsive design contact us by clicking this link](mailto:hello@wellingtonweb.co.nz?subject=I'd%20like%20to%20know%20more%20about%20responsive%20design)

[MTB Downhill Madness](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-ndjddud-l-jy/)

For those of you who know me well, you know anything on a bike is my idea of a great time. Having said that, here's my idea of a potentially awful time - it's helmet cam footage of New Zealand's own Kelly McGarry doing a backflip over a 72 FOOT CANYON GAP!!!! Absolutely insane and stunning all at once.

Have you upgraded your robot?

![Robot](https://i6.createsend1.com/ei/r/FA/8D7/69F/csimport/Mecha_bastards_by_machine56.150001.jpg)

Websites are like robots - we create them to do jobs for us. If their job is to make us money, then we need to make sure that they're running at 100% efficiency. If your website runs Wordpress, the latest version is 3.7.1 and it may be time for an upgrade.

**Top reasons to upgrade your Wordpress install:**

*   **Security** - to protect from the latest threats and attacks
*   **Speed** - to ensure your site is snappy and loved by Google SEO
*   **Functionality** - there's newness with every new version of Wordpress
*   **Compatibility** - to ensure the latest technologies work with your site

Until next time,

Yours,

Truly,

Ezra
