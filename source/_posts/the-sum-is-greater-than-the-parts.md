One of the things that I love about being an Information Architect is when things in general cross boundaries and combine to make something new and different. Examples of this could be when someone uses something in a functional and useful way that maybe wasn't the way it was originally intended to be used - ie. 1. [Google Maps API keys that get used to do mash-ups with You-tube and Flickr.](http://www.jonnygoldstein.com/2008/02/25/google-mapyoutube-mashup-from-22108-dc-social-media-club-meeting/) 2\. [Ikea cupboard being used for a hideaway computer workstation.](http://ikeahacker.blogspot.com/2008/03/wardrobe-to-computer-workstation.html) 3\. [Playstation 3 with Linux installed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_for_PlayStation_3) But in this case it's with two different genres of film. This Start War vs. Saul Bass Video is two genre's coming together where the parts were already pretty damn cool (Star Wars + Saul Bass) but the sum is somehow much cooler.

Disclaimer - when I refer to Star Wars as 'cool' I am of course referring to the original three 'sequels' Episodes 4, 5 and 6. Not that other junk that George Lucas tried to feed us a few years ago.
