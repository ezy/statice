I found [this](http://flickr.com/photos/juhansonin/2345837597/sizes/o/) case study/ presentation on Flickr today by [Juhan Sonin](http://www.mit.edu/~juhan/) and there were two things about it that really struck me. [![Interface design presentation](2345837597_61f9432c53_o-171x300.jpg "2345837597_61f9432c53_o")](2345837597_61f9432c53_o.jpg)

1.  The first is just how much information there is on the web about any subject you want to know about. So since I’m interested in interface and user experience it’s all there and given an infinite amount of time and resource, I can tap into all of it and become better at what I do. Fantastic.
2.  And the second is that this case study/presentation on interface has become its own effigy, by being converted into screenshot format and uploaded to a site which was originally intended for people to store their holiday snaps etc. etc. It’s a great idea, and I love it how a site or webtool can take on a life of its own as users driven by need, reinvent the brief for which the site was originally designed.

Can the web get any better than this. [Yes, yes it can.](http://del.icio.us/ezytiger)
