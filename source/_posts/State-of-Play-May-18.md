In the [last issue](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-y/) I made a big deal about how truck drivers were going to be replaced, and computers are taking all the jobs. Well I'd like to make a redaction folks, because apparently there's a [huge truck driver shortage](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-j/) in the USA. Go figure. In other news, coffee is now good for you and red wine will send you to an early grave. Or was that other way round? I can never remember.

What you can expect in this issue:

*   Parents, children and technology are problematic
*   Instagram is hacking your brain
*   Some lazy links
*   Tech showcase
*   25 points for Adulting

## Our offspring have smart phones- this is concerning

When it came to parenting, both **Steve Jobs** and **Bill Gates** are [famous for being technophobes](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-t/). They both had a clear idea about putting boundaries in place as parents, [and they’re not alone amongst their Silicon Valley counter-parts](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-i/) holding back tech from their kids.

![Uncle Steve](https://i1.createsend1.com/ei/r/68/E50/1FF/140439/csfinal/1200px-Steve_Jobs_Headshot_2010-CROP.jpg)

When I was growing up in the 80’s my parents were similar in that they were pretty technophobic, and it wasn’t until I was 13 in the early 90’s that they finally caved and purchased a shiny new 486 (which didn’t even have a modem). But the challenges of access to tech for kids back then (and even when Steve and Bill’s kids were young) was quite different to what it is now **with the ubiquity of internet** enabled devices.

As a parent, navigating the sea of technology can be pretty tricky. Our kids started with an old slow tablet (a feature not a bug), shared between them when they were young - mostly reserved for movies on long car trips.

Then a couple of years back we bought a second tablet so they could both separately access their Spotify accounts (despite searching in vain for nonexistent commercial [standalone Spotify players](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-d/)). Last year, we opted for [dumb phones](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-h/) so they could get hold of us when out and about on their own.

But this has quickly escalated to smart phones when we passed on our old mobiles to them, and I’m yet to decide whether we’ve made a rod for our own back or not.

We’re living in a time where technology is a given for kids, but the guidelines are blurry or vacant. The impact on our relationships and culture from tech is often hard to qualify, as the rate of change and acceptance is moving **so much faster** than any known period of history. Even the printing press [took a good few hundred years to be widely adopted](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-k/).

## So how do we deal with it?

I’m a big fan of education over austerity - and would rather spend the time and effort trying to arm our kids with principals of general good behaviour to trust their behaviour, rather than locking down every device we have. Having said that we do use a [free net filter that blocks all adult related content](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-u/) on our home network. That's enough for now IMO, but if anyone has any other good tips please let me know.

# The Instagram Experiment

Instagram is a fabulous horrible beast. All at once it’s a quasi family album come personal social marketing tool where you live your “best life” while everyone and no-one looks on. I met a few prolific instagrammers with tens of thousands of followers recently, and I decided to run a bit of an experiment to kick the tyres of the platform and see how easy it was to build followers and likes (_my start count was 215 with around 8 likes per post_).

![All the colours of the Insta-rainbow](https://i4.createsend1.com/ei/r/68/E50/1FF/140439/csfinal/instagram-scheduling-automatic-pubishing-opinion.jpg)

For Science, the method used was to search for the most popular hashtags on a subject using one of the many free Android apps, and then attach the tags in a comment to posts. From there, a script in Google sheets pulled in the follower count every 6 hours and plotted progress on this chart.

![The data is dataey](https://i5.createsend1.com/ei/r/68/E50/1FF/140439/csfinal/InstagramstatsGoogleSheets.png)

## But the data from the results wasn’t that interesting.

**In brief**: the net follower gain over the month was just **26 users**. There was some interesting follow/unfollow behaviour, and differing post exposure based on the Instagram algorithm, but really nothing worth writing about.

**By far the biggest learning** was how addictive the hash tagging became. During the experiment I’d compulsively check back and refresh the feed to see the stats climb after a post. And for a short time (after effectively stopping the experiment), went back to adding hash-tags _because the dopamine hit was so good_. Facebook have really nailed the design pattern of likes and follows to target and fire serotonin receptors. It’s the same effect that drugs and alcohol have on the reward centres of our brain specifically focused to the pleasure we [usually gain from meaningful relationships](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-o/).

## Big brands understand all of this

They affiliate with “authentic” Instagrammers whose lives resonate the values that the same brands are desperate to project. Film studios understand this, and [actors are often given parts](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-b/) on the basis of how much their Instagram follower count will promote the movie. In an online world built on the back of advertising, our culture is subtly changing to reflect **the new Gods we have chosen**. And we can struggle to adjust to this, as we essentially remain largely unchanged as a species, with the same inbuilt drivers formed over thousands of generations.

The Netflix show [Black Mirror](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-n/) nailed the tension between our behaviour drivers and social interactions in the episode “[Nosedive](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-p/)”, where every human interaction allows one person to rate the other. Their social score then influences the opportunity and privilege they’re afforded in life. It's hard not to surmise this sort of system as a logical conclusion for social.

![Nosedive](https://i6.createsend1.com/ei/r/68/E50/1FF/140439/csfinal/sec_3127907.jpg)

It's not a new concept though. **Back in 1977** in an interview with Vogue Magazine titled “The future of the future”, the [author JG Ballard](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-x/) predicted social media with a finger firmly on the pulse of the human condition:

> _All this, of course, will be mere electronic wallpaper, the background to the main programme in which each of us will be both star and supporting player. Every one of our actions during the day, across the entire spectrum of domestic life, will be instantly recorded on video-tape. In the evening we will sit back to scan the rushes, selected by a computer trained to pick out only our best profiles, our wittiest dialogue, our most affecting expressions filmed through the kindest filters, and then stitch these together into a heightened re-enactment of the day. Regardless of our place in the family pecking order, each of us within the privacy of our own rooms will be the star in a continually unfolding domestic saga, with parents, husbands, wives and children demoted to an appropriate starring role._

JG Ballard: Probably not photo-shopped

Perhaps we don’t step back and take an objective look at our behaviour and engagement often enough? It was surprising to me how addictive the whole experiment became, and subsequently I’ve deleted the Instagram app from my phone. I’m not sure if it’ll stick or not, but I have felt much less cluttered than usual this week. As far as an outcome to the experiment goes, it's a good one.

Here’s [the raw data sheet](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-m/) with accompanying Javascript macro for anyone who’s interested.

# NZ tech radar

It's easy to think of tech related stuff in NZ being fresh new ideas, built by millennials in their bedrooms during their down-time playing [Fortnite](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-a/); but Radio New Zealand (which is itself a type of millenial having been formed in 1995) is nailing digital as a channel.

[![RNZ](https://i8.createsend1.com/ei/r/68/E50/1FF/140439/csfinal/RNZ-logo-reo.jpg)](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-f/)

For anyone who's hasn't listened yet, [here's a link to their podcast section](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-yd/). In an age of cheap one dimensional journalism they're doing God's own work in digital. My favourite podcast so far is [Go Ahead Caller](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-yh/) with Ken Oath. It's well worth a listen - Laughs all round.

## Rounding out

I’ll sign off with the excellent [Principles of Adult Behaviour](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jyidtyyk-l-yk/) from one _John Perry Barlow_. It’s a jolly good list from a particularly interesting human:

1.  _Be patient. No matter what._
2.  _Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn’t say to him._
3.  _Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you._
4.  _Expand your sense of the possible._
5.  _Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change._
6.  _Don’t ask more of others than you can deliver yourself._
7.  _Tolerate ambiguity._
8.  _Laugh at yourself frequently._
9.  _Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right._
10.  _Try not to forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong._
11.  _Give up blood sports._
12.  _Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Do not endanger it frivolously. And never endanger the life of another._
13.  _Never lie to anyone for any reason._
14.  _Learn the needs of those around you and respect them._
15.  _Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that._
16.  _Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun._
17.  _Praise at least as often as you disparage._
18.  _Never let your errors pass without admission._
19.  _Become less suspicious of joy._
20.  _Understand humility._
21.  _Forgive._
22.  _Foster dignity._
23.  _Live memorably._
24.  _Love yourself._
25.  _Endure._
