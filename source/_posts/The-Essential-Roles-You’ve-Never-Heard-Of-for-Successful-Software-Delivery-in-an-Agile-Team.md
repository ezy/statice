Titles or Roles in many industries are often meaningless, and nowhere is this more apparent than in ICT software delivery. Companies will hire a person for a team with a list of “essential” and “desired” skills in the job description (JD) but mostly, 30% of what you end up doing is outside of those lists and whatever is needed to get on with delivering. Over several years I’ve had the privilege of working in some great teams, and delivering some pretty amazing projects. These are the roles I’ve observed that are essential to a team’s, project’s and company’s ultimate success in Agile Software Delivery. And it’s likely you won’t see them advertised in a JD anytime soon.

## The Leader

The Leader is usually person one on the project, and in charge of hiring the team and starting the team culture. They can be any of the roles below, but they should be part of the day to day delivery of the product so they've got real skin in the game. There are good recruiters and HR people out there who you can outsource hiring to. But I’ve only ever come across one, out of the hundreds I’ve met who I’d trust to build a small group of the right sort of people for delivering software in an agile environment. Good leaders are hard to find, and if you do get your hands on one - hold onto them for all you’re worth.

## The Product Expert

The Product Expert should be someone who either knows the pains and struggles of the customer intimately, or is good at translating those pain points into documents the team can use to build a tangible product. Roles that often fill this vital position are: any JD with “Product” in the title, Project Sponsor, Business Analyst, UX/UI Designer or anyone involved as a go between the upper management team and the designer. Without this person there is a 99% chance the product won’t fit the purpose it was designed for.

## The Bull Dog

The Bull Dog protects the team from Management and let’s them make mistakes, solve problems without external pressure and create their own weird culture without interference. Roles that often fit into this position can be many and varied: Technical Lead, Software Architect, Project Manager, Agile Coach or Business Analyst. Without this person and in the absence of a 200 page technical specifiaction that only one person reads to gain power and influence - the higher ups get nervous and start flapping about with worry. This causes a great deal of stress for everyone working on the product and effects quality of delivery.

## The Technical Boffin (and Legacy Expert)

The Technical Boffin has intimate knowledge of all the companies existing systems. More importantly they know the legacy system gatekeepers required for integration with the project. It’s essential they’re good at working well with others and have some sort of rapport with the legacy gatekeepers. Humility and patience with people, and the courage to ask forgiveness rather than permission in product delivery are great traits for this person. They require a somewhat rare mix of technical and people skills. Roles that fit the bill for this are typically Architects, or Technical Leads. Without this person legacy product integration tends to get in the way and start blowing out time and costs.

## The Backlog Gardener

The Backlog Gardener can be anyone, but whoever they are they need to own and run the ticketing system. This enables the team to be autonomous at pulling work from the backlog. Without them, the teams efficiency and comms are greatly reduced. Then bottlenecks start forming throughout the work cycle. No individual on earth is as good as an autonomous team at keeping the delivery velocity high.

## The Team Whisperer

The Team Whisperer is the person who brings everyone together. They’re friendly and personable and often not the best person on the team. In fact they can often be the worst performer from an output perspective. They bring fun and brevity, and without them there’s a high chance your team can burn out, or end up head down and joyless.

## The One That Gets Shit Done

The One That Gets Shit Done is a misnomer because it’s everyone else in the team, and their sole purpose should be to produce work directly related to the product at maximum velocity. If all the other roles above are filled, this team can be small, and the more senior the members the smaller it can be. If the right people are hired, skills are less important than cultural fit. You can teach someone with the right attitude anything. But it's harder to teach a talented experienced team member not to be a dick.

## Summary

A large organisation with the right people who loosely fit this structure, can quite literally save millions of dollars in delivery costs, and their product has the highest chance of succeeding and being the best fit for market. The flow on effects of this are success and market dominance. The wrong people, even in a green fields project create technical debt from day one. The right people are essential to success, and without them your funds are probably better spent on marketing.
