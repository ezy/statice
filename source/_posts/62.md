I hope you all enjoyed the lecture yesterday Aaron gave. Included in this post is an example of Brand Guidelines - specifically the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) Visual Identity version 1.1. It's an excellent example of how thorough and in-depth an agency delves to specify how a brand should be applied from stationary to contractor signs.Â  Overall you should gain some insight and inspiration from this document for your final brand document if your brand is digitally based. If your brand document is more concrete - existing in the physical world - then it may help to incorporate this style and approach into your A3 board as more of a Visual Identity. [NZTA - Visual Identity Guidelines - v1.1](http://blogs.mediazone.co.nz/2009-dmdn206/files/2009/07/visual-identity-guidelines-v1-1.pdf) (PDF - 1.2mb) Remember that there is no "right" way to do this project. Often it is very difficult when there are few parameters as it is in this case. But the aim is that each of you end up with a personal brand that is true to your discipline and yourself. And make sure you revisit the project brief and keep the Approach, Objectives and Assessment Criteria in mind as you continue to work through the process.[](http://blogs.mediazone.co.nz/2009-dmdn206/files/2009/07/nzta.jpg)
