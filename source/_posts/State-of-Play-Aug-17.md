It's Friday and almost the end of August, and where the heck is the year going?

It's been a busy few months all in all. A government contract I'm working on at the moment is full steam ahead, and in the last three months my github code commit additions and deletions are looking pretty solid:

_299 commits, 1542 file changes, 30454 insertions(+), 14841 deletions(-)_

In this month's issue it's all about playing around with the content. As we all know "[The Internet is a Playground](https://twitter.com/sambgrover?lang=en)", and over the years I've run my fair share of experiments. About a year after I joined Facebook I experimented with adding all the people Facebook suggested I should friend. A lot of people said "who the hell are you?". But no one declined my invitation. Another time I automated a flickr feed of fixed gear bikes to [automatically post to tumblr](http://marketing.passionfruit.co.nz/t/r-l-jljhuiyd-l-j/) which ended up with 3000 odd subscribers. Or the time I paid $15 for 1000 twitter followers (back in 2010), testing out a new site called freelancer.com. I was skeptical that the work would be completed, but 24 hours later [my follower count](https://ffffixie-blog.tumblr.com/) was 1000 fake accounts higher. Interestingly, twitter has slowly culled most of those profiles and I'm roughly back at the same 2:1 ratio I was before the work was done. Today, "followers" is a degraded metric on the back of those sorts of rorts. It's all about "authentic engagement" now. Even Facebook's own Instagram is looking at ways to [keep it real](https://www.vox.com/2017/6/14/15792402/instagram-celebrities-branded-paid-content-posts-ads-advertising-ftc), with plain packaging around promoted content by its influencers.

### What you can expect in this issue:

*   A guest spot
*   My notes from Deloitte's session on tech investing
*   Profiling a kick ass NZ start-up
*   Two brain-blastingly interesting links with summary

_Read time about 5 min_

I'm particularly excited to open up a guest spot in this issue, with a view to publishing some unique voices in the tech sector. For this issue, Sam Grover (a.k.a Slam Grover, a.k.a Spicey Sean) has been kind enough to pen a few words. I met Sam during an 8 month stint contracting at Xero with the marketing team back in 2011. His article, an ode to that app he used that one time, continues below.

### Goodbye Budget App, we hardly knew you.

A couple years ago, I downloaded the NZ Budget App. Perfect, I thought. Just what I need to keep track of where my tax dollars are going, from anywhere, at any time. I looked at it once. It was pretty cool. Then I closed out of it and never looked at it again. A couple weeks ago, I saw that it had been quietly chucked in the garbage.

My point here is that there are a lot of apps being put to pasture as their organisations realise they can't possibly justify the eye-watering investment. I have no idea how much that Budget app cost to develop, but it can't have been cheap.

With that in mind, when should you make an app? You can actually answer this question pretty easily -- just have a little think about the apps you frequently use right now.  For me, it's  probably Facebook, Uber and Metservice. For jet-setters, the Air NZ app will probably be close to the top of the list.

These apps all share an attribute: they do something for me _right now_. Facebook tells me what kinds of banal pictures my m8s have posted. Uber gets me to where I need to go. Metservice tells me whether I'm going to have to contend with a stiff headwind on my bike ride.

This is in marked contrast to an app that is just a portal into content. I don't want to be too unkind to the Budget app (RIP). It did a a great job of showing me beautifully displayed governmental budget information. But Budget information only updates once a year. I'm never going to log in and check to see if there have been any updates; I know there aren't any. Actually, I have limited need to _ever_ look at budget documents, but when I'm trying to settle an argument with someone about the cost of Superannuation ($13.7b a year and rising), I can do so from the comfort of my computer.

So when you sit down to develop your app, ask yourself: does this solve an immediate problem for someone? Does this serve up new content? Is there really, truly, a difference between using this app and just going to your website?

If not -- don't bother. It's not worth the time, effort and pain.

## On tech investment

I was up in Auckland this week at Deloitte's monthly meet-up, DPC. They had three speakers for the event discussing their companies different approaches to early stage investment. The three speakers were [David Beard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-beard-99110216/), partner of Movac, [Dana McKenzie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniela-mckenzie-92a01b26/?ppe=1), Vice Chairperson of The ICE Angels, and [Ben Fahey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-fahey-a4341938/) Head of Corporate and Commercial at the BNZ. It was a great chance to hear a diverse range of investors' points of view, and different strategies. These are my top takeaway notes from [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com):

### Top takeaways

*   Movac is focused to companies with $1M revenue at 8% ROI year on year. 15-30% equity is their target investment.
*   NZ companies take too long to fail. It typically takes around 6-8 years to kill an idea in NZ. The writing should be on the wall within 2-3 years.
*   BNZ, like all banks are desperate to get into the tech sector, but reading between the lines, their risk profile and old fashioned approach basically hedges them out of the entire tech start-up scene.

## The most exciting start-up

_Each issue, I'm going to post about the most exciting new tech I've come across recently. _

While I was up in Auckland, one of my fellow DPC members, [Sam Blackmore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-blackmore-9a459a56/) had some pretty great news - he's gone full-time on a business that's been slowly gathering momentum over the last while. He's created [My Bitcoin Saver](https://vimba.co/), a subscription service to bitcoin.

If you know a bit about Bitcoin in NZ you'll know that it's not easy to buy. This product is looking to solve that problem, all rolled up in a savings and investment scheme. Especially appealing to millennials who feel locked out of traditional investment classes it's an easy way to "set and forget" an investment strategy for a small contribution each month. And if the [mad](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kwn5yy/john-mcafee-bath-salts-belize-murder-fugitive-gregory-faull) (_link - nsfw_) tech guru John McAfee [is to believed](https://nypost.com/2017/07/19/cybersecurity-legend-i-will-eat-my-d-k-if-i-lose-500k-bitcoin-bet/), it's a pretty good way to setup a future nest-egg.

I'm completely sold on blockchain based tech, and I'm super excited about companies like this popping up around NZ. Unfortunately the banks are being [like a coy dutch woman guarding a dark secret](https://www.quotes.net/show-quote/63461), and My Bitcoin Saver are currently on hiatus whilst they "develop new banking relationships". But with the sheer range and scale of non-bank solutions out there I wouldn't be surprised if they're up and running soon again. Anyway, if you know anyone in the banking sector desperate to not be left behind by blockchain, get in touch with [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-blackmore-9a459a56/).

## Two links

_Evernote is a pretty great tool for bookmarking web content, and there's a fare few links in my folder by the end of the month. Here's the best two from my most recent finds._..

### Link one: Which co's have your back?

[https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2017](https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2017)

More and more my bookmarks folder is starting to look a bit tin-foil hat like. And then there's Keith Jensen:

{% asset_img KeithLowellJensenonTwitterWhatOrwellfailedtopredic.png Orwellian %}

So it's good to know which mega companies have your back if the folks in power decide that you're [suddenly on their black list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...) for playing World of Warcraft, or if like Liam Neeson you have a "[certain set of skills](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/fbi-arrested-cyber-expert-marcus-hutchins-who-ended-wannacry-attack-us-marshall-service-4781285/)". I'm a big fan of the EFF and try and donate to their cause every once in a while. They're doing God's own work, because the internet is potentially the [most powerful weapon](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/internet-isnt-vulnerable-weapon/) we've ever made.

### Link two: You know it's bad when...

[https://pressfreedomtracker.us/](https://pressfreedomtracker.us/)

In a similar vein [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/) and the [Committee to Protect Journalists](https://cpj.org/) launched a site this month aiming to detail the suppression of press freedom in the good ol' USA.

It's fair to say that of late, things have been [a little bit cray cray](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/08/17/a-nazi-salute-a-kkk-hood-and-trump-magazine-covers-after-charlottesville-are-jarring/) in the land of the free. So it's good to see the power of data being used to cut through some of the fake news and fake news headlines.

## Rounding out

I'm not sure yet what the final form of this email newsletter is going to be, but I can assure you it will never be stuffy, and it will always be related to tech. My motives are based solely on having an utlet to share the crazy and cool things I come across as a serial tech-head. And failure is a hot topic these days, so invite your friends to sign-up if they want to hear the perspective of a 2.5 time, serial start-up failure. There's a subscribe link too if anyone needs it. Cher.
