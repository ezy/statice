For project 3 everyone is required to have their own URL (eg. www.this-is-a-url.com). Some of you may already have a URL which you want to use and some may not. We have deliberately left getting a URL until third project so that if you don't already have one, you can be considered about the wordmark/domain name you choose. This should be heavily influenced by the material around your branding. There are many different tools for helping you find a URL. [http://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/domainname.shtml](http://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/domainname.shtml) \- good advice on choosing a name [http://domai.nr/](http://domai.nr/) \- a URL search engine for finding the right name Ultimately, the golden rules for choosing a domain are that in a social situation:

*   you shouldn't have to repeat your domain name
*   you shouldn't have to spell it for people

Once you have decided on a domain name you will also need a web-host. This should be relatively cheap, and for your requirements shouldn't cost you more than $15 NZD per month. There are even free web-hosts around that offer limited space and options if you know where to look[.](http://www.passionfruit.co.nz) [Top 10 webhosts](http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=top+10+webhosts&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) [Best webhost](http://delicious.com/search?p=best+webhost&chk=&context=all||&fr=del_icio_us&lc=1) [![http://www.flickr.com/photos/89234258@N00/2466530429/](http://blogs.mediazone.co.nz/2009-dmdn206/files/2009/09/2466530429_b91c2484d2.jpg)](http://blogs.mediazone.co.nz/2009-dmdn206/files/2009/09/2466530429_b91c2484d2.jpg)
