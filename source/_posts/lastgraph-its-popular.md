You know a sites popular when you are 2000th odd in a queue to see a visual representation of user data on your last.fm account. And that's the case with this beautiful tool from [lastgraph](http://lastgraph3.aeracode.org/). As you can see though from the screen grab below, I'm still waiting for the result. But the teaser images promise so much.
