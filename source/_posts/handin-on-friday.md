At the moment there are two important pieces of information regarding the hand-in on Friday:

1.  All hand-ins are to be made into the hand-in folder. This will be available as of Thursday - projects must be ready to go in the folders for the crit on Friday.
2.  You don't need to hand in a hard copy of the A3 document - so all hand-ins are digital format only.

Any questions - I will be in tomorrow morning between 9am and midday. Email for a time to meet. ![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3006/2964494003_1c8b8c5a6b.jpg)
