Apologies for the blow-out on Friday before the break. There were huge outages on the VUW network, and establishing a reliable internet connection was not possible. I'm pretty annoyed about this, but Doug is following up with the IT department at VUW. I was hoping that you would all be able to have a breather before we start on Project 3 which is promising to be very involved. Its also worth 40% which is a hefty part of the course grade. **So make sure you're prepared for the new hand-in time which will be during class-time on the first Tuesday back. Thats the 8th of September if you want to make a note of it in your diary's.** The times stand from the previous sign-up sheet which is attached as an image. Any questions or comments feel free to twitter @ezytiger. Looking forward to seeing the work when you get back.
