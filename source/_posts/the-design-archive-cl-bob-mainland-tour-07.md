Was looking back through the archives today and stumbled across this poster inspired byÂ Hundertwasser I did for my good mate Simon in CL Bob. I based the design on a photo of an old stump that had bright orange fungi growing around the top in our back yard at the time. Good times. ![hundertwasser](http://ezra.keddell.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hundertwasser.jpg)
