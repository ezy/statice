See the screencast here - [friday-tasks-090807](http://blogs.mediazone.co.nz/2009-dmdn206/files/2009/08/friday-tasks-090807.mp4) The things that need to be accomplished by the end of today are as follows:

1.  **Wireframe diagrams completed**. I have created a template that opens in Adobe Fireworks and has layers of a few different content types to get you started. You'll notice the width is 1024px which is the conventional standard for browser size currently if you want 90%+ of people to be able to view your website in their browser.
2.  **Photoshop diagrams completed - v1**. The expectation is that you design several iterations in Photoshop for the design of you're tumblr blog. This will make it much easier for you to concentrate on the coding when you get to the coding stage, as well as for the tutors to be able to point you in the right direction based on a solid visual image. There is a Photoshop template to assist you if you haven't already started yet.

The Delivery outline in the Project 2 Brief has been arranged in order, so that you can follow a process. Remember that design is a process, not an accident. ;) On Tuesday we've got a guest lecturer coming in - in class after the lecture we'll be looking at the completed wireframes and v1 of designs.
