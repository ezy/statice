let me count the ways... [This article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/05/29/applying-divine-proportion-to-web-design/) from [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) is absolutely brilliant. It talks about layout and rules in different disciplines that can be applied into designing web pages. These being the rule of thirds and the golden ration. There is some extremely compelling writing and examples included also. Images for eye candy and preview, [hit the link to go to the actual article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/05/29/applying-divine-proportion-to-web-design/). **The Golden Ratio** [![](404user2-300x266.jpg "The golden ratio")](404user2.jpg) **The rule of thirds** [![](demandw-300x255.jpg "The rule of thirds")](demandw.jpg)
