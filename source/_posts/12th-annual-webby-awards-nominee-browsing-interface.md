The webby awards site has a really nice flash [interface for browsing the 12th annual webby awards](http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/ "webby flash previewer") nominees and winners. In short all the sites up for a silver spring are represented by a small icon about the size of a favicon. Then there are filters that can be applied located along the bottom of the interface to filter by winner type, media type, trends, and location. There’s been a couple of times where I’ve been browsing the [categories](http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=12 "12th webby categories list") to see what’s what, and been frustrated by the long extended pagination of the site. The [flash previewer](http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/ "Webby flash previewer") deals with browsing fantastically though.
