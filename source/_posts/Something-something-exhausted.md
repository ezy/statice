Getting back on the horse
Img of me
Eastbourne
Auckland summary (100 words)
energy levels
wearing too many hats
the pressure to succeed

Learnings from Kandid
The vanity of publicity
railroaded by the $dragon
needing to prove myself
imposter syndrome
good parts
remote working
slack
appear.in

Tools that worked Start-ups and other failures
Getsafely
poor choice of business partner
profile over substance
chasing the $dragon

Dotty and greener pastures
Enjoying the kids
side hustle
sustainability
quality rather than growth mindset
organic growth
no deadline pressure
my dog
camp
perspective
energy
