I've set up a voting page for tutorials on [Slinkset](http://d206.slinkset.com/). Because there is a lot of technical requirements in this project, and there a re a lot of you we'll be delivering video tutorials for the aspects of the project that people are struggling with. So if you want to suggest a tutorial simply add it to the list over at [d206.slinset.com](http://d206.slinkset.com/). Also I would appreciate it if people would vote for tutorials that they need most. This will give a hierarchical order and we can deliver the tuts based on priority.
