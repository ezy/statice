The project 3 brief has been uploaded. The final project will be a portfolio site that demonstrates branding integrated with past projects. Students will use a full range of digital media and web technology to present their final concept on their own URL, complete with supporting documentation. Precedents should be gathered as a starting point before authoring the project outputs. Tumblr blogs should be incorporated into the portfolio site in some way, wither by RSS using "updates" or as a link in the main menu.
