What is our Public Domain? How much control do we have over it? How can we leverage social media to our advantage? In the current modern environment we are constantly being exposed to brands that feed us information in a variety of ways through visual media, social interaction, label bashing, behavioural and speech patterns, music, restaurants, bars, clubs - almost every level of social society both on and off line. A dialogue is going on between people and products complete with its own language and nuances. This project is about intentionally fronting your own brand and harnessing the language and culture that is in your sub-conscious, to promote yourself in the context of your chosen vocation. Understand what the word 'brand' means in the marketplace. In this project you will create your own brand experience by using:

*   A precedent that resonates with you, complete with supporting influences as a case study (research)
*   Key elements drawn from your own work/life/personality. Relate these elements to your brand and show a considered interpretation

**DELIVERY:**

*   A brand experience document in a format of your choosing
*   A hard copy supporting research, elements and influences document displaying your process and precedents (A3 format)
*   3 high res brand images (1 colour, 1 on white background, 1 on black background) - 4 mega-pixels

**APPROACH:**

*   Research and gather precedents for your project from internal and external sources
*   Create a number of 'brand sketches' that define the layers of your brand and how and where the brand is applied
*   Pull together the strongest material into a single A3 document that shows your process
*   Implement your final brand as a brand experience in an output format that fits the brands identity

**OBJECTIVES:**

*   Understand that a brand is more than an image, word-mark or strap-line
*   Develop a considered intentional approach to self-promotion and perception
*   Present a clear picture of your design point of view in a concise framework

**ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:** The following Assessment Criteria will be used by the tutors to grade the hand-in for Project 01:

*   Clear documentation of the process, showing a clear progression from initial concepts to final identity
*   Demonstration of creativity, experimentation and expression with deliberate attention to overall style, look and feel including a high level of craft and attention to detail
*   Final brand experience document displays a clear link to vocational field, research interests, and/or personal disposition. This is reinforced by the supporting research, elements and influences document.
*   Display of technical skills and proficiency within the utilised software/hardware - techniques, textures, plug-ins, editing capability, materials
*   All tasks completed with consistency and quality
